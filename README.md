*Acknowledgment*
Might come as a supprise to some great minded individuals who looked at a problem and developed a solution, as of the time of the creation of this README file I am not financially able to get a system but with the help of projects that some brilliant minds have developed I am able to code and learn a lot with a moblie device, special thanks to the creators of Termux Android Emulator, Android Code Editor, Acode. And special thanks to Julien @Alx Africa and all Alx team members.

*Ps*
This project was inspired by the thought of how difficult it is/was for newbies to purchase data for coding. The app is aimed to simplify and reduce the cost. The journey to becoming a tech nerd gets difficult as one makes progress, and without sheer will, it is nearly impossible to make it till the end...
